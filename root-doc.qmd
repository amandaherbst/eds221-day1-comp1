## Read in data

```{r}
# read_csv is better than read.csv
energy <- read_csv("data/us_energy.csv")
```

Create a line chart of energy over time, with color based on energy type

```{r}
names(energy)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = energy, aes(x = year, 
                          y = quadrillion_btu)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = type)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Energy (quadrillion btu)")
```
